# SigScale CSE
This application provides a Service Logic Execution Environment (SLEE)
for Service Logic Processing Programs (SLP) implementing an operator's
custom services. Several protocol stacks are supported including CAP,
INAP, DIAMETER, RADIUS and REST.

==Provided SLPs==
Provided SLPs support real-time charging for prepaid services with
CAP (CAMEL), INAP and DIAMETER interfaces. These SLPs implement the
Online Charging Function (OCF) of a decomposed OCS (Online Charging
System) (3GPP TS 32.296) using the
<a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/SigScale/nrf-rating/1.0.0">
NRF_Rating</a> API on the Re interface to a remote Rating Function
(RF) such as SigScale OCS.
 
==Inteligent Network (IN)==
SigScale CSE performs the Service Control Function (SCF) in an
Intelligent Network (IN), providing a platform to support a network
operator's customized service logic. The 3GPP CAMEL Application Part
(CAP) protocol is supported, providing a CAMEL Service Environment
(CSE), as well as ETSI INAP for wireline operators.
